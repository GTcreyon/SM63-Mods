This SWF creates a function, _root.stringData();, which takes two inputs, both strings. This SWF is used to store data in strings, in the format <myVar:12345> or <myVar2:hello world>. If <myVar:12345> were to be put in a level title, _root.stringData("myVar", _root.LDCourseName); would return 12345.

How this SWF should be used:
This SWF should be loaded in a sign or level title, preferably level title
