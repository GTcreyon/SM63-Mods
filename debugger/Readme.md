The debugger comes in two forms. Form a uses CinemaMessage, which is reliable but ugly, and form b uses AreaTextClipF, which doesn't always work but is much neater.
They both load code from a file named payload.swf, which has to be located in the same directory as the SM63 executable.
The supplied payload.swf autoruns code in frame1 -> doAction.
Usable commands can be found in the SM63 functions/variables documentation spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/document/d/13sxWrE0VPPTQm5_gqSrjqK4_DFgGBH04kK6z3PAy2w8/edit?usp=sharing).
You can run the code ingame by pressing the minus (-) key.
Usage: Download payload.swf and place it in the same directory as your SM63 executable. Create a new level designer level, place a sign and enter either <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runouw-Mods/SM63-Mods/master/debugger/a.swf"> if you want to use form a or <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runouw-Mods/SM63-Mods/master/debugger/b.swf"> if you want to use form b. Premade level codes are available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runouw-Mods/SM63-Mods/master/debugger/Debugging.txt if you want them.
Test the level and open the sign. Click the 'Activate' button to begin debugging or 'Deactivate' to end.
Once activated, press minus (-) to run payload.swf.
